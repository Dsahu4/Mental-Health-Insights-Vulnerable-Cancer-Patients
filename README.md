Mental Health Insights: Vulnerable Cancer Patients


Collected over 10,087 posts from cancer patients and their caregivers on platforms like Reddit, Daily Strength, and the Health Board. The posts were related to five types of cancer: brain, colon, liver, leukemia, and lung cancer. Two team members scored each post based on the emotions expressed, using a scale from -2 to 1. Negative scores (-1 or -2) were given for posts showing grief or suffering, positive scores (1) for happy emotions like relief or accomplishment, and posts with no emotion received a score of 0 and were considered neutral. This analysis aims to understand the emotional aspects of cancer patients posts for a mental health study.
In this project, I worked with a dataset containing mental health insights for cancer survivors and their caregivers. The primary goal was to clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to understand mental health trends and vulnerabilities.

1.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
o	Imported and examined the dataset, handled missing values, and applied various preprocessing techniques such as removing null values, punctuation handling, tokenization, and lemmatization to clean the text data effectively.
o	Utilized libraries like pandas, nltk, and BeautifulSoup for these tasks.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Conducted thorough EDA to understand the distribution of mental health conditions and their intensities among the survivors and caregivers.
o	Visualized the data using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to create insightful plots like count plots and pie charts, identifying key trends and patterns.
3.	Text Analysis and Visualization:
o	Generated word clouds to visualize common terms used in the posts, providing a clear picture of prevalent mental health topics and concerns.
o	Implemented text cleaning methods to prepare the data for further analysis, including stopwords removal and text normalization.
4.	Feature Engineering and Model Building:
o	Employed feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF to convert the cleaned text data into numerical features suitable for model building.
o	Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
o	Built and trained a predictive model using XGBoost, achieving significant accuracy in predicting mental health conditions.

5.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports to ensure its effectiveness.
o	The model demonstrated high accuracy in both training and testing phases, indicating its reliability in predicting mental health issues among the target population.
This project required a blend of technical skills, analytical thinking, and a deep understanding of data science principles. By successfully executing this project, I have demonstrated my capability to handle real-world data, apply advanced machine learning techniques, and derive meaningful insights that can inform better decision-making processes.
